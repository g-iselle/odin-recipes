    <p>Are you unsure about how to make the most of your leftover salmon? Here's a tasty and convenient method to transform it into a quick, weeknight-friendly dinner. Remember to set aside a portion of pasta water as it acts as a natural thickener for the lemon-garlic pasta sauce, giving it a velvety texture.</p>

        <li>8 ounces whole-wheat pasta</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
