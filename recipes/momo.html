    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> In a large bowl combine the flour & salt. Pour in the hot water a little at a time, either kneading with your hands or with a dough hook attachment to a mixer (I used my stand mixer. I'm sure you could also use a bread machine). Keep adding water & mixing/kneading until you have an elastic dough that is no longer sticky (if you used a mixer, it's good to knead by hand for the last stretch to make sure it's the right consistency--like noodle dough & pizza dough). If the dough id too sticky, knead in a small amount of flour, if it's too dry, add water. You get the idea. The amounts of water to flour are general & depend on your climate. To keep the dough from drying out,  put tit back in the bowl & cover it with a slightly damp towel or simply put the bowl upside down over the dough.</li>
        <li>If making the savory filling, blend/process or chop very small, the cabbage, mushrooms, & cilantro & then put them in a large bowl. Add the rest of the ingredients to the bowl & combine with our hands. If making the sweet filling, process/blend/chop small the walnuts, dates, & raisins & then put them in a bowl & add the tofu, honey, & spices. Mix with your hands. Put the filling in the fridge until ready to use.
            (If you'll be steaming your dumplings, set up your steamer now & get the water on its way to a boil. Remember to keep an eye on your steamer water level so it doesn't run out & you burn the bottom of your pot!)</li>
        <li>Separate the dough into manageable sections, like thirds, keeping the dough you're not working with under the bowl or towel, & roll it out on a lightly floured board to about 1/8 in. thickness. Use a circle cutter or cup rim, about the width of your palm or a little greater, & cut as many circles as you can, re-rolling the dough & cutting until there's no dough left. As you make circles, stack them (they should not be sticky, remember?) & cover them with an upturned bowl or slightly damp towel. Repeat this with all of the dough sections until all you have are a bunch of dough circles.</li>
        <li>Bring your filling from the fridge & set it close to your work surface with the circles. Lay one circle at a time in front of you &, using either the rolling pin or your fingers, flatten & stretch out the edges of the dough circle even more (you want the edges to be thinner than the center). Next, place a tablespoon-sized amount of filling in the center of the circle. To close the dumpling, gather the edges in by pleating & flattening upward as you go around. As you pleat round & round the dough will close up like a little pouch. Once the opening is as small as you can get it, pinch it together & twist. Carefully break off any excess dough at the top. You can see in the pictures that I made a little circle at the top of my momos. This is common & a way to lessen dough thickness at the top (maybe). Using your thumb, index, & middle finger, carefully pinch the dough around the top until you get a raised circle (FYI, long fingernails are not so hot for this).</li>
        <li>To steam the dumplings, brush oil on your steamer tray & place the dumplings in, about 1/2 or a little less apart. Steam for about 10-12mins & then remove to a serving plate. Serve hot.</li>
        <li>To fry the dumplings, melt some butter (Tibetan's love butter, it's good against chapped lips) in a large pan (make sure it's a pan with a lid) & then add the dumplings. Fry top & bottom until browned & then pour in 1/4 cup or so of water & put the lip over the pan. Steam the dumplings in the pan for about 5 mins or until they are soft & cooked through. Serve hot.</li>
