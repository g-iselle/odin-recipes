    <h3> Fresh pasta, with its shorter cooking time compared to dried pasta, becomes an essential ingredient for quick weeknight dinners like this indulgent yet nutritious dish.</h3>
    <p>he creamy sauce relies on eggs as its foundation, and since the eggs are not fully cooked, you may opt for pasteurized-in-the-shell eggs if desired.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>½ cup panko breadcrumbs, preferably whole-wheat</li>
        <li>1 small clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>8 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>3 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 (9 ounce) package fresh tagliatelle or linguine</li>
        <li>8 cups baby spinach</li>
        <li>1 cup peas (fresh or frozen)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Put 10 cups of water in a large pot and bring to a boil over high heat.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add breadcrumbs and garlic; cook, stirring frequently, until toasted, about 2 minutes. Transfer to a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons Parmesan and parsley. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Whisk the remaining 6 tablespoons Parmesan, egg yolks, egg, pepper and salt in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Cook pasta in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute. Add spinach and peas and cook until the pasta is tender, about 1 minute more. Reserve 1/4 cup of the cooking water. Drain and place in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Slowly whisk the reserved cooking water into the egg mixture. Gradually add the mixture to the pasta, tossing with tongs to combine. Serve topped with the reserved breadcrumb mixture.</li>
    </ol>
